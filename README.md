# blockchain-based-cloze-test is on the verge of getting the world record for th worlds biggest close  test using  machine learning it is possible to auto generate clozes test .

close tests is innovative way of learning by neccesity and  intution . the concept is simple lets use an anerlergy  of a cloze text.
                  
                 
   n/b each gap will be linked to an individual block in the blockchain
                 
                  cloze 1  with 5 gaps

   players will try to fit words int this gaps and  try their luck 
   a single attempt will be charged 1 EtH
   prizes  will be 2 ETH and above . we will be ussing metamask for this demo
                 

                        ATTEMPTS 



 
A) being concerned       1 ETH
B) concerned             1 ETH
C) having concerned      1 ETH         every attempt has an  EQUAL attempt  fee 1 Eth
D) concerning            1 ETH
E) to have concerned     1 ETH


  You have successfully mineq the block with congratulations you have earned 10 ETH





the cloze above has 5 gaps each gap becomes a block each block is endependent and can have multiple answers

players are given the task to mine for this answers . due to rarelity  some answers will be worth more eth 

each block gap will be linked to the other using a global hash 

the global hash is just the hash of the passage without gaps .

players are give the task to guess the right word to activate the next level.

using blockchain we are able to keep track of the player progress . this by  chained proof of  work .

using the metamask players can get assistace from other players  by making metamask  purchaces. 


the metamask xtension is  linked  to the program.
